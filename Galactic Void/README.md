## Galactic Void
This project was my first large scale game that I started back in early 2013 all the way though the year.
The entire project was meant to be a "infinite" space exploration game with combat and trading. Almost as if you took an X game and made it 2d.
This project does **not** represent me as a programmer today as I believe I have improved.

The latest implementation was of a lua based modding system after c++ dlls showed their flaws.

It's a bit spagetti so you have been warned..

### Dependencies:
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_mixer

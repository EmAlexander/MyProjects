## QTCuebicEngine
This was meant to be a full game engine using lua and possibly python. This project was never finished due to me figureing out at the time that a fully functional engine like this was too large for me at the time. Has a 'almost' fully functional entity editor where you can select and move objects via the details panel. Nothing too special but personally I think the opengl window implementation I made was pretty good at the time.

## Dependencies
- QT
- Lua 5.2
